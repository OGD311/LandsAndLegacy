# Lands and Legacy
## No Adventures the Same...
* Procedurally Generated Worlds
* Building
* Mining
* Combat

Welcome to Lands And Legacy, a project I have developed as part of my A level Computer Science NEA (Non-Exam Assessment). It is *quite* basic (in my opinion) but does consist of several features that I think are quite cool:
Menu System - Players can customise the world before it is created
Procedurally Generated World - World is generated based off of a seed
Biome Generation - Worlds can have deserts, forests and grassland
Building/Mining - Players can place and break blocks to their hearts content
Combat/Enemies - Enemies will spawn randomly and try to hunt the player down; fend them off with your trusty sword
Health - You have a limited amount of health; don't let it reach zero or you'll be back to square 1
